# JSP-Banking-portal
A banking portal project based on jsp/html/css/javascript/sql.
Features of portal: transaction history,transfer money,bill pay,check balance,credit,debit,admin panel

This is an Advance java project. To run the project you will need Apache tomcat server and SQL. 

Sorry to make the installation hard, but I have hardcoded SQL commands in the project.
So you have two options:

1)Install mySql and set it's password as 'admin'.

2)[Hard way] Find all the instances of the word 'admin' in the project and replace them with your current mysqlpassword.
